üõ°Ô∏è IoT-GEN: Multi-Purpose IoT Security Guard Edge Node
IoT-GEN is a robust IoT security edge node designed to simulate, detect, and defend against real-world RF and Wi-Fi attacks. Operating exclusively on the 433 MHz frequency, it integrates attack emulation, signal analysis, and real-time defense mechanisms using Temporal-Statistical RF Frame Filtering. Built on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W with wireless modules, it offers a compact and powerful solution for IoT security testing.

Wiring Connections

TFT Display (128x128):
SCK: GPIO11 (SPI Clock)
MOSI: GPIO10
DC: GPIO24
RESET: GPIO25
CS: GPIO8


RF Transmitter (STX882): GPIO20
RF Receiver (SRX882): GPIO21

üß† Project Features
The GUI is divided into four main sections, with all RF operations conducted on the 433 MHz frequency:
1. Intro

Displays a welcome screen with basic project information.

2. Security Features

RF Jamming Detection: Identifies interference on 433 MHz signals.
Capture My RF Key: Captures 24, 32, 64, or 128-bit codes.
Rolling Code Capture: Logs rolling codes transmitted at 433 MHz.
Key Reuse: Replays captured 433 MHz RF signals.

3. Attack Simulation

Fixed Code Cloning on 433 MHz
Rolling Code Cloning on 433 MHz
Passive Keyless Entry Replay Attack
RF Jamming Transmission at 433 MHz

4. Wi-Fi Attack Emulation

Scans WPA/WPA2 networks
Performs Deauthentication attacks
Captures handshake packets
Stores .cap files
Supports password cracking using rockyou.txt

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Interface: Navigate the system using a joystick-controlled GUI.
RF Operations (433 MHz exclusive):
Signals are captured via the SRX882 receiver and decoded in real-time.
Employs Temporal-Statistical RF Frame Filtering to enhance signal accuracy by analyzing temporal patterns and statistical properties of RF frames.
Replay or jamming signals are transmitted via the STX882 transmitter.


Wi-Fi Attacks: Automated Python scripts leverage airodump-ng, aireplay-ng, and aircrack-ng for attack execution.
Storage: Results are displayed on the TFT screen and saved in /storage/.

üß© Future Improvements

Implement an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) for RF behavior anomaly detection.
Convert the device into an Access Point (AP) for remote security logging.
Expand frequency support to include 315, 868, and 915 MHz alongside 433 MHz.
Encrypt logs and enable secure over-the-air updates.
